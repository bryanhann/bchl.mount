USAGE
-----
    myborg.device.scan

    This script is called, not sourced. When called it will activate all
    mounted client devices. These clients will modify the environment by
    adding environment variables that start with [DEVICE_]. This script
    will then dump these to STDOUT for the user to process. The user's
    environment will be unchanged by the call.

    NOTE:
        The script will search for clients at known mountpoints. Such
        mountpoints include:

            [/Volumes]      for macos
            [/media/$HOME]  for raspberry pi

        These values are currently hardcoded.

        XXX move them outside of the script.

USAGE
_____
    source myborg.device.src.register -t [KEY VALUE]

    This must be sourced only from a file within an [.insitu]
    folder. The following will be executed: 
        export DEVICE_{name}__ROOT__=/some/mountpoint/{name}
        export DEVICE_{name}_{KEY}=/some/mountpoint/{name}/{VALUE}

OVERVIEW
--------
    The scripts [myborg.device.*] are intended to allow client 
    devices mounted on the filesystem to report information about
    themselves. This is done dynamically by executing the script
    [myborg.device.scan] which will activate all found clients.
    The clients in turn will report information about themses
    by sourcing the script [myborg.device.src.register].

CLIENTS:
-------
    A client is any mounted devices that has the file
    [./.insitu/acivate] (aka its 'activating script')
    relative to it's mountpath. A client is activated
    by sourcing this activation script from within its
    [./insitu] folder. This script should modify its
    environment by sourcing [myborg.device.src.register]
    which will create environment key=value pairs of the
    form
        DEVICE_{NAME}_{KEY}={VALUE}

    Example:
        A client mounted at 
            [/some/mountpoint/Foo]
        is activated by sourcing
            [/some/mountpoint/Foo/.insitu/activate]
        from within the folder
            [/some/mountpoint/Foo/.insitu].
        This activation script consists of the lines
            1. [source myborg.device.src.register -t MUSIC my/music].
            2. [source myborg.device.src.register -t FTP   data/ftp/data].
        The result is that the following is added to the environment:
            1. [$DEVICE_Foo_MUSIC]   -->  [/some/mountpoint/Foo/my/music]
            2. [$DEVICE_Foo_FTP]     -->  [/some/mountpoint/Foo/data/ftp/data]
            3. [$DEVICE_Foo__ROOT__] -->  [/some/mountpoint/Foo]

        It is the responsibility of the user to set such values in a way
        useful to the user. Typically these values will represent a path
        to a folder or file on the device that provides some service.

        Note the third result. This is automatically set whenever a client
        sources [myborg.device.src.register]. If this is the only value the
        client wishes to export, the script may be sourced witn only the
        argument [-t].
